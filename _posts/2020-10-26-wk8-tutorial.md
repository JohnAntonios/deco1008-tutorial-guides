subtitle: Assessment 1D part 1 - Learning about materials and textures in Blender!
---

This is Week 8's tutorial where you will learn about materials and textures in Blender with your 1B PokeBall and stand.

## Objective

Your objective is to animate your Assessment 1B PokeBall! You will be **required** to create a PokeBall that is textured and materialised like so:

**The extra step will be available in part 2 next week!**.

Let's first create our A1D Blender File.

1. Locate your A1B Blender File.

   ![Step 1 - Image 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image1.png)`

2. Duplicate this file (copy + paste) and rename it to **DECO1008_A1D_YourUnikey**.

   ![Step 1 - Image 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image2.png)

3. Open this new Blender file.

<br />

The Material tab is where we can add, delete and modify any material in our file.

1. Select any **mesh** in your scene.

   ![Step 1 - Image 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image1.png)`

2. Located in the inspector toolbar, is a checkered circle icon - this represents the _Materials_ tab. Clicking on this icon will show the Materials pane.

   ![Step 1 - Image 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image2.png)

   Let's break this down.

3. At the top is a list of materials that have been applied to the selected object. Currently there are no materials applied to the selected object.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

4. Below the list of materials, is a dropdown where you can select a different material to apply to the object (more on this later).

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

5. The preview pane can be clicked on, this will preview the material on various meshes that can be chosen from.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

6. Below this, is the surface pane. This is where we can adjust properties of the material, such as:

   Base colour (Albedo map).

   Metallic - amount of shininess.

   Specular - amount of reflection.

   Roughness - amount of smoothness.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

7. However, you will notice that currently we cannot see the changes we make to the material. We need to change the view we are in, from **Solid** to **Material**.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

8. You will now see the Mesh’s material in the viewport!

## Step 5 - Applying a texture to the Stand

### Video

<iframe width="100%" height="320px" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://sydney.instructuremedia.com/embed/87702c33-c8b3-4f1c-9faf-b88260c8d74c" frameborder="0" class="media">

<br />

Let's now go ahead and create our first texture-based material for the PokeBall's Stand!

1. Select your Stand.

   ![Step 1 - Image 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image1.png)`

2. Go into the Materials tab.

   ![Step 1 - Image 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image2.png)

3. If a Material hasn’t already been created, press the + New material.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

4. Rename the material to “Ocean_Blue_Texture”.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

5. Select the yellow dot near the **Base Color** property.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

6. Select **Image Texture**.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

7. You will now see some new properties under Base Color.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

8. We now need to find a texture, let’s google one. A common search query is “Texture 256x256” where 256 is the dimension size. This is a standard quality texture. There are higher quality textures but are more costly: 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048 and 4096x4096.

   Textures are a type of surface that can be applied to a 3D object. They are commonly represented in a 2D image known as a texture map.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

9. Download the above image and name it “pokeball_stand_texture”.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

10. In Blender, press **Open** under the **Base Color - Image Texture** section and select the downloaded texture, and press **Open Image**.

    ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

11. And you will now see the texture applied to the Stand as a material!

    ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

12. You will see that there is some light reflection, we can adjust the roughness and specular amount to combat this.

    ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

## Step 6 - Applying a material to the Lid

### Video

<br />

We now want to add the same “Light_Grey” material, but to our Lid. However you will notice that the lid is union-ed to our Top_Shell and we cannot apply it directly.

You may be thinking, that’s an easy fix. Separate it from the Top_Shell then apply the material! However, that is not only inefficient but will make it more difficult to reunite with the Top_Shell.

1. Select the **Top_Shell** and go into edit mode and ensure you are in **Face** selection.

   ![Step 1 - Image 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image1.png)`

2. Carefully, while holding shift select all the **faces** that make up the **Lid** component of the **Top_Shell**.

   ![Step 1 - Image 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image2.png)

3. Now go into the Material tab and press the Plus Icon located to the right of the list of materials.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

4. Below, click on the dropdown and select the “Light_Grey” material.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

5. Now press **Apply** at the top!

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

6. We now have two materials applied to our object.

## Step 7 - Applying a texture to the Rings

### Video

<br />

The last thing we need to do is apply a texture to the **rings** of the Pokeball.

1. Let’s first find a texture for the rings, I will be using the below texture from the interwebs.

   ![Texture 2](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/026dcb_ef575afee551409097428823b11f5d03~mv2.jpg)

2. Download and save this as “pokeball_ring_texture”.

   ![Step 1 - Image 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image2.png)

3. Select the Top_Shell and go into edit mode, ensuring face selection is on.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

4. A slightly quicker way than individually selecting all of these faces is to hold CTRL while holding Shift and select a face that is along the ring but further away. This will also select the faces in-between. Repeat this until you have the entire ring selected.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

5. Now go into the Material tab and press the Plus Icon located to the right of the list of materials.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

6. Rename this to “Dark_Silk”.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

7. Change the Base Colour input to Image Texture.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

8. Select the downloaded Dark Silk texture file.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)

9. Now repeat this but for the Bottom_Shell. Note, instead of creating a new material you can simply select the Dark_Silk material again.

   ![Step 1 - Image 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/wk7-tutorial/step1-image3.png)
